# Webauthn Demo

This is a demo project for me to test how to use webauthn.

Junky, but working.

This project will store public keys and user information to `/tmp/pubkey-repo.json` for test purposes.

This is tested on MacBook Pro with TouchID, a Oneplus 7 Pro with fingerprint sensor, both under the latest version of Chrome browser.

This project is only for me to apply for the Drupal GSoC, and should not be used elsewhere because it is so junky.
